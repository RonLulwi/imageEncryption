# imageEncryption
This application allows you to encrypt text as an image and extract the same text from the image. Additionally, it provides functionality to save and upload images to the mobile device gallery.

## Encryption Method
The encryption method used in this application follows a technique known as Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. In this method, the application hides the text message within the pixels of an image by modifying the least significant bit of each color channel (red, green, and blue) in the image.
